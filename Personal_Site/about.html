                For me, a healthy work-life balance helps me be a great collaborator and best serve the needs of those I am working with. Here are some of the ways I achieve that balance.
            </h3>
            
            <h41>
                Golfing
            </h41>

            <p1>
                Golfing helps me clear my mind when I feel it becoming a bit cloudy. Golf has served as an escape and stress-management tool in my life and I am so glad to have found it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I found golf in my college years when I started playing with a friend. It was something I never thought I would be interested in. It wasn't until I started seeing all of the results of my practice and hard work to improve that I fell in love with the game.
                <br>
                <br>
                Golf teaches me to be patient and stick with it through the end, which I take into my work and personal life as well. It is a very hard game to learn and there are a lot of downs when you can't figure out a certain swing or dial in a certain club. However, once I finally see results I can't help but feel an overwhelming joy and release of tension and that is the feeling I chase when I play golf.
            </p1>

            <h42>
                TV/Movies
            </h42>

            <p2>
                Another escape I have found to de-stress and clear my mind is TV and movies. I value the creativity and storytelling that goes into creating TV and movies and I love to get lost in it from time to time.
                <br>
                <br>
                Though watching television does not necessarily bring out my own creativity, I do feel that it helps me learn about other people's versions of creativity and stories that I may then be abel to pull from later in my own creative ventures.
                <br>
                <br>
                All in all, I enjoy the escape of television so much and am always stuck on a new TV show or raving about the last movie I watched. It is something that bonded my family and I early on in life and I'm sure I will be unapologetically recapping full TV shows to my peers for long time to come.

                My Dog, Belly
            </h43>

            <p3>
                My favorite way to create a healthy work-life balance is spending time with my dog, Belly. He is a 4 pound Chihuahua mix and he makes my days so much brighter than they were without him.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having this little guy to come home to each day can make the worst days better. He helps me to reset and begin each day with a fresh, new perspective.
                <br>
                <br>
                I can't say enough how grateful I am to Belly and the light he brings to my life!
