Denver Axelsen's Personal Website Project Repository

- This repository contains all of my files and work related to the "Personal Website" project.

- This project is a website to showcase myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages.

- The website contains a Home page, About page, and Portfolio page.

- The website was made using all 3 of the languages mentioned above to create a well-rounded showcase of the lessons and skills I have learned so far in my Fullstack Academy course as well as some skills I've learned on my own.
